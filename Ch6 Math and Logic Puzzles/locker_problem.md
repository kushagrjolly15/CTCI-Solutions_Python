    A locker is toggled in ith walk if i divides locker number. For example the locker number 45 is toggled in 1st, 3rd, 5th, 9th and 15th walk.
    The locker is switched back to initial stage for every pair of divisors. For example 45 is toggled 6 times for 3 pairs (5, 9), (15, 3) and (1, 45).
    It looks like all locker would become closes at the end. But there are locker numbers which would become open, for example 16, the pair (4, 4) means only one walk. Similarly all other perfect squares like 4, 9, â€¦.
    
    So the answer is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 and 100.
