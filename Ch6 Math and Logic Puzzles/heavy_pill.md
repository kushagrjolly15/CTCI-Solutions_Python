Step 1: arrange the bottles on the shelf and now take, 1 pill from the first bottle, 2 pills from the second bottle, 3 pills from the third bottle, and so on.


Step 2: Ideally, you would have (20)*(21)/2=210 pills weighing 210 grams. When you put the entire pile of pills on the weighing scale, the deviation from 210g would tell you which bottle contains the heavy pills.

Step 3: If the deviation is .1 gram more, it is the 1st bottle which has heavy pills, if it is .2 gram more then 2nd bottle has heavy pills, if it is .3 gram more then 3rd bottle has heavy pills, if it is .4 gram more then 4th bottle has heavy pills, and so on.
